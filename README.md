# web-crawler-v2
My second web-crawler made with TypeScript
## Usage
This webcrawler takes a starting url and collects urls relative to the domain. The crawler will visit all possible relative urls.<br>
The starting location can be changed at the bottom of `index.ts`

To compile the TypeScript into JavaScript, run the command:<br>
`tsc index.ts`which will output `index.js`
<br><br>
To run the application you must have NodeJS installed, run the command:<br>
`node index.js`
